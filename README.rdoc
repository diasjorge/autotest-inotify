= Autotest Inotify

== DESCRIPTION:

Autotest relies on filesystem polling to detect modifications in source code
files. In other words: The filesytem is constantly being traversed which
causes quite some load on both the CPU and the harddrive. This is not healthy
for your machine and if you are working on a portable computer, it will drain
your battery.  Linux offers libinotify which is a very efficient way to have
the operating system monitor file alterations. This gem teaches autotest to
use libinotify and therefore be nice to your machine.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* Linux
* rb-inotify
* autotest >= 4.2.4

== INSTALL:

First install the gem:

  sudo gem install autotest-inotify

Then add the following line *after all other requires* in your ~/.autotest
file:

  require 'autotest/inotify'

== THANK YOU:

Inspiration for this gem came from work done by Alban Peignier's[1], and Sven
Schwyn[2]
